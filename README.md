#### Features

- Currency conversion between USD, INR, and EUR.
- Real-time conversion rates.
- User-friendly interface.

#### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software:

- Node.js and npm (Node.js 14 or higher is recommended)
- A modern web browser

#### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

- Clone the repository

```
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd currency-converter

```

- Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

- Start the development server

```
npm start
```

This runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

- Running test

```
npm test
```

Note: When running tests, there may be issues related to the axios-mock-adapter package, which is used for mocking API calls in tests. These issues can cause tests to fail unexpectedly.
